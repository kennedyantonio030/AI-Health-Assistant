const welcomeMessage = (fullName?: string) => `🤖 Hi ${fullName ? fullName : ''}! It's Mediar, your health assistant! 👋 

To help me understand best how events in your life affect your health, simply send me tags about your daily activities, moods, foods, workouts, etc. 

For example:

- ☕ Had coffee
- 😊 Feeling happy 
- 🍎 Ate an apple
- 🏋️‍♀️ Did 30 mins workout

FYI, I can deal with grammar mistakes and typos! 🤓

You can also send me pictures of your meals, workouts, drinks, etc. 📸. I'll try to understand what's in the picture and tag it for you! 🤖

I'll use these tags to provide personalized daily insights on how to improve your focus, sleep, stress and general health! 🧘‍♀️🥰

If you want to know more about your health, just ask me questions like:
- How can I improve my sleep?
- How can I reduce my stress?
- What's my focus score?

If you have any feedback or questions ❓ about Mediar, just join the Discord community or email 💌 louis@mediar.ai.

Your health matter ❤️🥦💪🧠`
